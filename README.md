##### Documentation Guidelines

1. If the variable name is a single word, then use all lower cases, for example, 'username' or 'password'. If there is a second word in the variable name, use camelCase.

2. Write DocStrings for every function, and also follow PEP8 styling except for URLs where practicality predicates not having the URL be broken across multiple lines.
